# Reproducing analyses

All the notebooks to generate the figures are in the notebooks with a [web](http://saket-choudhary.me/scRNA_NB_comparison/) and an [Rmd](https://github.com/saketkc/scRNA_NB_comparison/tree/master/analysis) version.

Scripts for running analyses on filtered datasets is in the [snakemake](https://github.com/saketkc/scRNA_NB_comparison/tree/master/snakemake) directory.
