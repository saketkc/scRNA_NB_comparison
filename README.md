# scRNA_NB_comparison

This repository contains scripts and notebooks to generate figures for our paper [Comparison and evaluation of statistical error models for scRNA-seq
](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-021-02584-9).

# Associated software

- [sctransform](https://github.com/satijalab/sctransform) 
- [pysctransform](https://github.com/saketkc/pysctransform) - Python implementation of sctranform with v1 and v2 regularization

# Raw datasets

An archive of all the raw datasets used in the analysis is avaialable on [this](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PhI0KoBD5CE8B2Qt7YyZHaTbTKJl7ur2/view?usp=sharing) Google drive.


# Reproducing analyses

All the notebooks to generate the figures are in the notebooks with a [web](http://saket-choudhary.me/scRNA_NB_comparison/) and an [Rmd](https://github.com/saketkc/scRNA_NB_comparison/tree/master/analysis) version.

Scripts for running analyses on filtered datasets is in the [snakemake](https://github.com/saketkc/scRNA_NB_comparison/tree/master/snakemake) directory.
